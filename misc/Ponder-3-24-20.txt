What does Fransico do with the fishing rod at the end of "El Angel de Oro"? Why?

Francisco tosses the fishing rod into the nearby creekafter discovering that the friend that gave him the rod, dissapeared.
I belive that he threw the rod into the river beacause he felt lonely, and it reminded him of one of his 'best' friends
that he only had for a day, was gone.He felt sad cleaning up the fishes in the mud, and sadder when it came to return them
since the friend was gone, he felt lonely, no one to play with, or hang out with. He threw the fishing rod into the creek
so he could forget of this misrible time in his life.
