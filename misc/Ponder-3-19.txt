This is our first Ponder. In this Ponder I am looking for two fully formed paragraphs (claim, lead-in, evidence, reasoning). 
This means that you should have 2 claims on how communication is different online and in person.

I don't know if the paragraphs need to be related. Like if they are next to each other in an essay, but I'm going to assume yes.

	Communication online compared to in person is purely the user's opinion. Do they enjoy looking a screen at someone? or do they like sitting down
next to the person to talk to? It is completely the the user's choice of if they want to go to that person's house üè† or FaceTime them. In some
cases, the easiest way to talk to that person (let's call him Jeff) is to contact him online since Jeff lives a hundred miles away, but when you want tophisicly talk to him, you have to get into your car and drive to his house, spending money on gas on the way. It's such a pain to spend money on gas
that it might not be worth driving all that way to Jeff's House just for a 10-20 minute visit, then spending money gas to come home. It is easier to message on FaceTime them.
	Online communication is key to communicating with family and friends far away, but some people are uncomfortable with not being able to touch
someone or not feeling the environment around the them, just home. Let's say Jeff has a friend that he hasen't seen in a long time, and they want to meet up. If
they FaceTime, they can't hug each other, they just wave. But if they were to meet up at a nearby park, they can hug, kiss, or whatever they want to, then maybe go to lunch.
Communicating online with friends and family is a helpful tool, but shouldn't be used excessivly to communicate with the same person onver and over again.
